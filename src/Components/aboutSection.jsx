          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-stone-300">
            The theme embodies the timeless pursuit of creating something that transcends the present and endures for generations to come. Anantya, meaning infinity, reflects the boundless impact of actions, values, and memories that continue to live long after moments have passed. It emphasizes the idea that true legacy is not confined to a single year or achievement, but is built through every effort, every bond, and every milestone that shapes the journey of Rotaract. This theme calls on us to leave behind imprints of compassion, leadership, and service. Memories that inspire, traditions that strengthen, and values that outlast time itself. "A Legacy That Lasts" is a reminder that our journey today becomes the foundation for tomorrow, ensuring that what we create together resonates infinitely, becoming a guiding force for those who follow.
